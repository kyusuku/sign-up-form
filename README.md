# Sign-Up Form

Sign-Up Form is a browser-based user registration form created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my sixth project, focusing on HTML forms and CSS styling. The project provides a structured and styled form where users can enter their personal information, including name, email, phone number, and password.

## How to Use

- ✍️ Enter your first name, last name, email, and phone number in the respective fields.
- 🔒 Type a secure password (minimum 8 characters) and confirm it.
- ✅ Click the "Create Account" button to submit the form.
- 🚨 If any field is invalid, the input box will highlight in red, indicating the need for correction.
